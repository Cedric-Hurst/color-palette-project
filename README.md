Massive Color Project that was a project for Colt Steele's Modern React Bootcamp.

This project was a bit outdated since the class was made about 3 years ago. In the course of this project I ran into many libraries that were outdate and I had to use new or different libraries (Most updated libraries now seem to use hooks). The original project that Colt did was made mostly using Class Components and did not use any hooks. and I changed them to be Function components and also used many hooks.
